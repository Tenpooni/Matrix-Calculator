# Row operations calculator

========================================================
## Proposal: *Phase 0*

\
**Questions:**
<p>1. What will the application do?<br>
The application will let a user input a calculator in augmented form <br>
and choose row operations to apply such as swap, scalar multiplication <br>
and addition.
<br>
2. Who will use it?<br>
Students working with algebra and matrices
<br>
3. Why is this project of interest to you?<br>
This project would have a connection to other courses I am taking and I <br>
enjoy being able to explore applications of programming to other fields.
</p>

**User Stories:**
> As a user, I want to be able to input an arbitrary length and width of calculator
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to view the state of calculator after each operation
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to add and remove row vectors
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to perform row operations such as swap, addition, subtraction and constant multiplication
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to save the state of my calculator
> 
> As a user, I want to choose between loading last calculator or creating new calculator

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by adding together two row elements and replacing 2nd inputted row with the result. Input row number inside entry text fields and hit the add button.
- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by swapping and reordering row objects through inputting which rows inside the entry text fields and hitting the swap button.
- You can locate my visual component by the top panel display for a representation of the current matrix state.
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button
