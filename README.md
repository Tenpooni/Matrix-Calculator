# Row operations calculator

========================================================
## Proposal: *Phase 0*

\
**Questions:**
<p>1. What will the application do?<br>
The application will let a user input a matrix in augmented form <br>
and choose row operations to apply such as swap, scalar multiplication <br>
and addition.
<br>
2. Who will use it?<br>
Students working with algebra and matrices
<br>
3. Why is this project of interest to you?<br>
This project would have a connection to other courses I am taking and I <br>
enjoy being able to explore applications of programming to other fields.
</p>

\
**User Stories:**
> As a user, I want to be able to input an arbitrary length and width of matrix
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to view the state of matrix after each operation
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to add and remove row vectors
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to perform row operations such as swap, addition, subtraction and constant multiplication
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to save the state of my matrix
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to load my most recent matrix
